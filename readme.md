**Developer:** Murat Karabiyik  
**Technologies:** MySQL 8.0, HTML5, CSS3, Git

## Project Overview
This repository contains a professional end-to-end data project. It features a custom-built MySQL database focused on E-commerce sales and Library management, integrated with a web-based reporting dashboard.

## Database Features
- **Schema Design:** Implemented the `Murat_Portfolio_Library_Sales` database.
- **Normalization:** Applied 3rd Normal Form (3NF) to ensure data integrity.
- **Relational Logic:** Used Primary/Foreign Keys and `ON DELETE CASCADE` constraints.
- **Advanced Querying:** Developed Virtual Views (`vw_Full_Library_Status`) and complex multi-table joins.

## Web Integration
The project includes a responsive HTML dashboard that visualizes query results, demonstrating the ability to bridge the gap between back-end data and front-end presentation.
